Markdown Compiler

Project Description: As described in class, the basic idea of a compiler is to take a high-level language and
convert it to a low-level language that can be executed on a computer. In this project, you will design and
develop an interpreter/compiler that translates my version of a Markdown language. Briefly, a Markdown
language allows for easy-to-read annotations within text that is then automatically converted to valid, wellformed
HTML5, and they have become quite popular with use in GitHub and Wikipedia. This semester,
the Markdown language we will design will be Gittex Markdown(i.e., GitHub â€“ Latex), a hybrid markdown
language mimicked after GitHub Flavored Markdown and Latex; Gittex Markdown will additionally
provide for statically scoped variables to be defined and used throughout the Gittex Markdown document.
